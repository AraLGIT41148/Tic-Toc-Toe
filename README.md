# Summary of Skills Developed

This exercise is designed to enhance problem-solving skills and familiarity with web development fundamentals. Here are the key skills and concepts reinforced through this exercise:

## 1. **Understanding and Applying Basic HTML**

- **Creating and Structuring Content**: Learners practice structuring web pages with HTML elements, such as buttons and divs, to create an interactive user interface.
- **Event Handling**: Implementing `onclick` attributes to handle user interactions and trigger JavaScript functions.

## 2. **Styling with CSS**

- **Layout and Design**: Skills in using CSS for layout design, including grid systems and flexbox, to position and style elements on the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Learning to ensure that elements adapt to different screen sizes and user interactions through responsive design techniques.
- **Hover and Active States**: Applying visual feedback for interactive elements, such as buttons, to enhance user experience.

## 3. **JavaScript for Interactivity**

- **Dynamic Content Management**: Using JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM based on user actions, such as marking cells in the game.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developing the logic for game mechanics, including win conditions, player turns, and draw scenarios.
- **State Management**: Managing the game state, including tracking player moves and determining the outcome of the game.

## 4. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Organizing Code**: Separating code into different files to improve maintainability and readability.
- **Linking Files**: Understanding how to link external files, promoting modularity and reusability.

## 5. **Problem-Solving and Debugging**

- **Logical Thinking**: Implementing algorithms to check for winning conditions and handle game state transitions.
- **Troubleshooting**: Debugging issues related to UI elements and ensuring that the game functions correctly after user interactions.

## 6. **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design**

- **UI Feedback**: Providing clear visual feedback to users, such as displaying win messages and handling game restarts.
- **UX Considerations**: Ensuring that the game is enjoyable and intuitive by focusing on interactive elements and visual clarity.

By working through this exercise, learners gain practical experience and enhance their problem-solving abilities in coding and design.
